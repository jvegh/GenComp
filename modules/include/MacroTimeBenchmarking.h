/*! @file MacroTimeBenchmarking.h
 *  @brief Macros for processor (CLOCK) time span passing between using the expanded codes
 *  @ingroup GENCOMP_MODULE_STUFF
 *
    These defined macros are benchmarking macros for measuring computing (clock) time of executing certain instruction sequences between them.
    The "MacroTimeBenchmarking.h" file shall be included in the header of the module in question.
    The results of the time measurements will be returned in user-defined variables.
    As the arguments are user-provided, with consistent use several independent
    measurement can be carried out within the source scope. The macros have source-module scope.
    All variables must be passed by reference.

    Notice: this is CLOCK time, returned by the processor; not SIMULATED time.
    When using in cooperation (and in an analog way with the corresponding without-'sc' macros, you may find out
    the CLOCK to SIMULATED time of the benchmarked activity

    The operating time offset due to benchmarking is approx 55-85 nanosecs, per macro pairs.

<b>Usage:</b>
    If the module includes this header, it must be preceded by defining
    @code{.cpp}
#define MAKE_TIME_BENCHMARKING  // uncomment to measure the time with benchmarking macros
    @endcode
   If this name is not defined, no code is generated  as code expansion for the module.
    The variables, however, must be defined (although they will be
    optimized out as unused ones).
    Alternatively, generating those variables may be protected with bracketing them by pairs
    @code{.cpp}
#ifdef BENCHMARK_TIME_BEGIN
#endif
    @endcode



<b>Example:</b>
    in your module, between the '\#include' files write

    @code{.cpp}
#define MAKE_TIME_BENCHMARKING  // comment out if you do not want to benchmark
#include "MacroTimeBenchmarking.h"    // Must be after the define to have its effect
    @endcode
It is a good idea to use these macro expansions at the end of heading block:
the similar macro definitions in included other modules may overload them

     In your class (or member function) define
    @code{.cpp}
    chrono::steady_clock::time_point t =chrono::steady_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration< int64_t, nano> x,s=(std::chrono::duration< int64_t, nano>)0;
    @endcode
    and use the macros as as
    @code{.cpp}
    BENCHMARK_TIME_RESET(&t,&x,&s); // Reset at the very begining, say in the constructor
    @endcode
    Later put the benchmarked code between macros, used as brackets
    @code{.cpp}
    BENCHMARK_TIME_BEGIN(&t,&x);    // Begin the benchmarking here
    your code
    BENCHMARK_TIME_END(&t,&x,&s);   // End benchmarking here
    @endcode
    After using these macros, the benchmarked time values are returned:
    (since BEGIN) in x (nanoseconds)
    and the sum of all benchmarked time (since RESET) in s (nanoseconds).
    Access the result as
    @code{.cpp}
    std::cerr  << "Simulation took " << s.count()/1000/1000. << " msec CLOCK time" << endl;
    @endcode

In an object, you can RESET in the constructor,
    in the member functions between BEGIN and END measure the
    one-time utilization, and in the destructor to read out the total benchmarked time.
Or to benchmark (in multiple variables) execution CLOCK time  about critical sections of your code.
Take care: control printing takes a along time.
