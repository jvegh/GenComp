# GenComp

GenComp is a visual simulator for illustrating the concepts of general computing, including both technical and biological computing.

**Experimental**: Under construction



## Usage
GenComp may be used to explore quantitatively concepts such as:
- How time-aware computing can enhance computing performance
- How efficiency of complex computing systems can be analyzed
- How biological computing can be interpreted and implemented
- How deficiencies of large technical implementations can be mitigated


## Downloading & Installation
In this early phase there no prebuild binary
